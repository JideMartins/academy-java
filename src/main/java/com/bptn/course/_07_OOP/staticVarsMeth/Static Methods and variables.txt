Summary
==========================================
Static methods and variables include the keyword static before their name in the header or declaration. They can be public or private.
Static variables belong to the class, with all objects of a class sharing that single static variable.
Static methods are associated with the class itself, not objects instantiated from the class.
Static variables are used with the class name and the dot . operator, since they are associated with a class, not objects of a class.
Static methods cannot access or change the values of instance variables, but they can access or change the values of static variables contained within their class.
Static methods cannot call non-static methods.
