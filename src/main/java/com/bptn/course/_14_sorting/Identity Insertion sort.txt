How to Spot Insertion Sort in Code
====================================================
To identify an insertion sort, look for the following:
1. An outer for loop that starts at one and loops through the entire array (see line 5 above)
2. Storing the element value at the outer loop index in temp (see line 6)
3. Setting the possible index to the outer loop index (see line 7)
4. An inner while loop that loops while the possible index is greater than 0 and the value in temp is less than the value at the possible index minus one (see line 8)
5. Set the value at the possible index to the one to the left of it (the one at possible index minus one) (see line 9)
6. Decrement the possible index (subtract one from it) (see line 10)
7. When the while loop ends, set the value at the possible index to temp (see line 12)
